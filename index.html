Made with the finest organic ingredients in Africa, Melanin Queens is garunteed to aid in hair growth and moisture. Melanin Queens was created in 2015 by Elayna Paulk, a Canadian native, and University of Miami student, who loves to dream big and embrace her curls with confidence and grace. Her self-motivation and her genuine care for others gives her the ability to encourage young people to embrace thier natural selves and always follow their dreams. Elayna was raised by a single mother, who always told her she could be anything she wanted to be in life. Though, she didn't have much as a kid, she remembered her mother's words and till this day, continues to follow her dreams. Although Melanin Queens is her first Entraprenueral endevor, Elayna isn't new to accomplishing set goals.

"My primary goal is to help women, like me, fall in love with their natural hair, no matter how curly, how thick, or how difficult to manage it may be. We are queens and our hair is an extension of our soul and it's imparative to take care of it."  </p>
